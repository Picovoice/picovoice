The demo outputs:

```text
[wake word]
```

Say

>turn on the lights

You should see the lights turned on and the following message in the terminal:

```text
{
    is_understood : 'true',
    intent : 'turnLights',
    slots : {
        'state' : 'on',
    }
}
```

The list of commands is shown below:

```text
context:
  expressions:
    turnLights:
      - "[switch, turn] $state:state (all) (the) [light, lights]"
      - "[switch, turn] (all) (the) [light, lights] $state:state"
    changeColor:
      - "[change, set, switch] (all) (the) (light, lights) (color) (to) $color:color"
  slots:
    state:
      - "off"
