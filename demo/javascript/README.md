# JavaScript Demos

The Picovoice JavaScript demos show Picovoice running in the browser using WebAssembly (WASM). All voice processing is done offline, meaning intrinsic privacy for user audio data. Read [Offline Voice AI in a Web Browser](https://picovoice.ai/blog/offline-voice-ai-in-a-web-browser/) for an introduction.

## "Vanilla"

This demo uses "Vanilla" JavaScript (no framework) to run in the browser.

## React

This demo is written in React and bootstrapped with Create React App. There is a [companion tutorial](https://picovoice.ai/docs/tutorials/using-picovoice-engines-with-react/) available.
