/**
 * Forward declaration for Picovoice end-to-end platform. Picovoice enables building voice experiences similar to Alexa
 * but runs entirely on-device (offline).
 *
 * Picovoice detects utterances of a customizable wake word (phrase) within an incoming stream of audio in real-time.
 * After detection of wake word, it begins to infer the user's intent from the follow-on spoken command. Upon detection
 * of wake word and completion of voice command, it invokes user-provided callbacks to signal these events.
 *
 * Picovoice processes incoming audio in consecutive frames. The number of samples per frame is
 * `pv_picovoice_frame_length()`. The incoming audio needs to have a sample rate equal to `pv_sample_rate()` and be
 * 16-bit linearly-encoded. Picovoice operates on single-channel audio. It uses Porcupine wake word engine for wake word
 * detection and Rhino Speech-to-Intent engine for intent inference.

 *
 * @param memory_size Memory needs to be 8-byte aligned.
 * @param memory_buffer Memory size in bytes.
 * @param keyword_model_size Size of keyword model in bytes.
 * @param keyword_model Keyword model.
 * @param porcupine_sensitivity Wake word detection sensitivity. It should be a number within [0, 1]. A higher
 * sensitivity results in fewer misses at the cost of increasing the false alarm rate.
 * @param wake_word_callback User-defined callback invoked upon detection of the wake phrase. The callback accepts no
 * input arguments.
 * @param context_model_size Size of the context in bytes.
 * @param context_model Context parameters. A context represents the set of expressions (spoken commands), intents, and
 * intent arguments (slots) within a domain of interest.
 * @param rhino_sensitivity Inference sensitivity. It should be a number within [0, 1]. A higher sensitivity value
 * results in fewer misses at the cost of (potentially) increasing the erroneous inference rate.
 * @param inference_callback User-defined callback invoked upon completion of intent inference. The callback accepts a
 * single input argument of type `pv_inference_t` that exposes the following immutable fields:
 *         (1) `is_understood` is a flag indicating if the spoken command is understood.
 *         (2) `intent` is the inferred intent from the voice command. If the command is not understood then it's set to
 *         `NULL`.
 *         (3) `num_slots` is the number of slots.
 *         (4) `slots` is a list of slot keys.
 *         (5) `values` is the corresponding slot values.
 * @param object Constructed instance of Porcupine.
 * @return Status code. Returns 'PV_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT', 'PV_STATUS_IO_ERROR', or 'PV_STATUS_OUT_OF_MEMORY' on
 * failure.
