# Java Swing Demo

A voice-controlled smart lighting panel using Java Swing and the Picovoice platform Java SDK.

Before running the demo, run the `copy.sh` script to copy wake word and context files from elsewhere in the repo.

Build the app with Gradle:
```console
cd porcupine/demo/java-swing
./gradlew build
```

Then launch the app:

```console
cd porcupine/demo/java-swing/build/libs
java -jar JavaSwingDemo.jar
```

For this demo, the wake word is `Javis` and the context is `Smart Lighting`. You can say things like:

> Jarvis, turn off the lights.

or

> Jarvis, set the lights in the bedroom to blue.

See below for the full context:
