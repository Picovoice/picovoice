# Picovoice Rust Demos

This Rust module contains demos for processing real-time audio (i.e. microphone) and audio files using the Picovoice Platform.

## Usage

NOTE: The working directory for the following `Cargo` commands is:

```console
picovoice/demo/rust/filedemo  # File Demo
picovoice/demo/rust/micdemo  # Microphone Demo
```

## AccessKey

Picovoice requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Picovoice SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

### File Demo

The file demo allows testing Picovoice on a corpus of audio files. The demo is mainly useful for quantitative performance benchmarking.
It accepts mono 16kHz WAV audio files.
The following processes a file looking for instances of the wake phrase defined in the file passed to the `--keyword_path` argument
and then infers the follow-on spoken command using the context defined by the file passed to the `--context_path` argument:

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} \
--input_audio_path "path/to/input.wav" \
--keyword_path "/path/to/keyword.ppn" \
--context_path "/path/to/context.rhn"
```

To see all available arguments, use the `--help` flag:
```console
cargo run --release -- --help
```

### Microphone Demo

The microphone demo opens an audio stream from a microphone and detects utterances of a give wake word(s).
The following processes incoming audio from the microphone for instances of the wake phrase defined in the file passed to the `--keyword_path` argument
and then infers the follow-on spoken command using the context defined by the file passed to the `--context_path` argument.
Upon completion of the spoken command inference it resumes wake word detection:

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} \
--keyword_path "/path/to/keyword.ppn" \
--context_path "/path/to/context.rhn"
```

To see all available arguments, use the `-h` flag:
```console
cargo run --release -- --help
```

It is possible that the default audio input device is not the one you wish to use. There are a couple
of debugging facilities baked into the demo application to solve this. First, type the following into the console:

```console
cargo run --release -- --show_audio_devices
```

It provides information about various audio input devices on the box. Here is an example output:

```console
index: 0, device name: USB Audio Device
index: 1, device name: MacBook Air Microphone
``` 

You can use the device index to specify which microphone to use for the demo. For instance, if you want to use the USB Audio Device
in the above example, you can invoke the demo application as below:

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} \
--keyword_path "/path/to/keyword.ppn" \
--context_path "/path/to/context.rhn" \
--audio_device_index 0
```

If the problem persists we suggest storing the recorded audio into a file for inspection.
This can be achieved with:

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} \
--context_path "/path/to/context.rhn" \
--keyword_path "/path/to/keyword.ppn" \
--audio_device_index 0 \
--output_path ./test.wav
```

If after listening to stored file there is no apparent problem detected please open an issue.
