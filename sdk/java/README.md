# Picovoice

Made in Vancouver, Canada by [Picovoice](https://picovoice.ai)

Picovoice is an end-to-end platform for building voice products on your terms. It enables creating voice experiences
similar to Alexa and Google. But it entirely runs 100% on-device. Picovoice is

- **Private:** Everything is processed offline. Intrinsically HIPAA and GDPR compliant.
- **Reliable:** Runs without needing constant connectivity.
- **Zero Latency:** Edge-first architecture eliminates unpredictable network delay.
- **Accurate:** Resilient to noise and reverberation. It outperforms cloud-based alternatives by wide margins
[*](https://github.com/Picovoice/speech-to-intent-benchmark#results).
- **Cross-Platform:** Design once, deploy anywhere. Build using familiar languages and frameworks.

## Compatibility

- Java 8+
- Runs on Linux (x86_64), macOS (x86_64) and Windows (x86_64)

## Installation

You can install the Picovoice Java binding by downloading and referencing the latest [Picovoice JAR file](/binding/java/bin/).

## Build

To build from source, we recommend using the [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). Open the .iml file with IntelliJ and
click "Build > Build Project" to build or "Build > Build Artifacts" to package as a JAR file.

## Usage

The easiest way to create an instance of the engine is with the Picovoice Builder:

```java
import ai.picovoice.picovoice.*;

String keywordPath = "/absolute/path/to/keyword.ppn"

PicovoiceWakeWordCallback wakeWordCallback = () -> {..};

String contextPath = "/absolute/path/to/context.rhn"

PicovoiceInferenceCallback inferenceCallback = inference -> {
    // `inference` exposes three getters:
    // (1) `getIsUnderstood()`
    // (2) `getIntent()`
    // (3) `getSlots()`
    // ..
};

try{        
    Picovoice handle = new Picovoice.Builder()
                    .setKeywordPath(keywordPath)
                    .setWakeWordCallback(wakeWordCallback)
                    .setContextPath(contextPath)
                    .setInferenceCallback(inferenceCallback)
                    .build();
} catch (PicovoiceException e) { }
```

`handle` is an instance of Picovoice runtime engine that detects utterances of wake phrase defined in the file located at
`keywordPath`. Upon detection of wake word it starts inferring user's intent from the follow-on voice command within
the context defined by the file located at `contextPath`. `keywordPath` is the absolute path to
[Porcupine wake word engine](https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine) keyword file (with `.ppn` suffix).
`contextPath` is the absolute path to [Rhino Speech-to-Intent engine](https://github.com/Picovoice/rhino) context file
(with `.rhn` suffix). `wakeWordCallback` is invoked upon the detection of wake phrase and `inferenceCallback` is
invoked upon completion of follow-on voice command inference.

When instantiated, valid sample rate can be obtained via `handle.getSampleRate()`. Expected number of audio samples per
frame is `handle.getFrameLength()`. The engine accepts 16-bit linearly-encoded PCM and operates on single-channel audio.

```java
short[] getNextAudioFrame()
{
    // .. get audioFrame
    return audioFrame;
}

while(true)
{
    handle.process(getNextAudioFrame());    
}
```

Once you're done with Picovoice, ensure you release its resources explicitly:

```java
handle.delete();
```

## Demos

The [Picovoice Java demo](/demo/java) is a Java command-line application that allows for 
processing real-time audio (i.e. microphone) and files using Picovoice.
