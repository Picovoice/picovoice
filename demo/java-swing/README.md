# Java Swing Demo

A voice-controlled smart lighting panel using Java Swing and the Picovoice platform Java SDK.

Before running the demo, run the `copy.sh` script to copy wake word and context files from elsewhere in the repo.

## AccessKey

Picovoice requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Picovoice SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Usage

Build the app with Gradle:
```console
cd picovoice/demo/java-swing
./gradlew build
```

Then launch the app:

```console
cd picovoice/demo/java-swing
java -jar build/libs/JavaSwingDemo.jar -a ${ACCESS_KEY}
```

For this demo, the wake word is `Javis` and the context is `Smart Lighting`. You can say things like:

> Jarvis, turn off the lights.

or

> Jarvis, set the lights in the bedroom to blue.
